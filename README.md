# GradInit
This repository hosts the code for experiments in the paper, [GradInit: Learning to Initialize Neural Networks for Stable and Efficient Training](http://arxiv.org/abs/2102.08098). 
 
Scripts for experiments on CIFAR-10 is currently available. Please refer to `launch/run_gradinit_densenet.sh` for DenseNet-100, `launch/run_gradinit_wrn.sh` for WRN-28-10, and `launch/run_gradinit.sh` for other networks shown in the paper. We will release the code for ImageNet and IWSLT experiments soon.
